      So far I have enjoyed all of the assignments in this class. I feel that everything I am learning will come up again in my future career. Dr. Evia is a very hands-on professor and is always willing to help his students. His fun loving attitude, and his enthusiasm for Visual Media makes the class more enjoyable for students.
