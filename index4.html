       <h1>Media Writing ~ W. Wat Hopkins Ph.D</h1>

<h3>Course Description:</h3>

<p>In my media writing class, Dr. Hopkins is teaching us the fundamentals of writing with an emphasis on news writing. We are learning AP style rules and how to apply them to our writing. The classroom is treated like an actual newsroom and our writing mimics the format and content of real reporters. The content covered in this course serves as an introduction to feature story writing, public relations releases, and broadcast writing.
</p>

<h3>Meet My Professor:</h3>

<p>Dr. Hopkins is very well established in the field of news writing and reporting. He holds many awards including: <i>Top Faculty Paper in Law</i>. He has also been involved in the writing of multiple books, including <i>Mass Communication Law in Virginia</i> and <i>Mr. Justice Brennan and Freedom of Expression</i>. He received his Bachelor’s degree from Western Carolina University, and his Master’s degree and PhD. from the University of North Carolina. He has worked in reporting positions for multiple newspapers including, the Fayetteville Times in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
</p>

<h3>My Opinions:</h3>

<p>Dr. Hopkins, is a very knowledgeable and wise professor and his experience in the journalism field is extremely helpful for students who do not have a lot of writing experience. His work ethic is something to admire, and his passion for journalism and news writing makes students appreciate him as a professor.
