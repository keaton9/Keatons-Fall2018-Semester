<h1>Media and Society ~ Jenn Burleson Mackay Ph.D.</h1>

<h3>Course Description:</h3>

<p>This course delves into the development of the media and its implications on society. It discusses censored books, social media mayhem, cultural issues influencing media across the globe, public relations campaigns, and video game madness. This course is designed to help students understand how the media encompasses their lives. Dr. Mackay discusses the history of media institutions and contemporary issues in the media as well as shedding light on a few scandals.
</p>

<h3>Meet My Professor:</h3>

<p>Professor Mackay has a passion for reporting and an addiction to journalism. Her main research is in journalistic ethics and the role political cartoonists play in society. In the past, she worked as a television journalist and a newspaper reporter. She is the former chair of the Media Ethics Division of the Association for Journalism and Mass Communication Educators. Nowadays, she is focused on helping her Virginia Tech students find her same love for journalism.
</p>

<h3>My Opinions:</h3>

<p>Throughout my time in this course, I have developed a greater understanding of the history of the media and the communication field. Iâ€™ve learned more about how the social media industry is growing and how it affects multiple fields, including politics. Through our discussions of many public news scandals, I have developed a greater understanding of how companies and individuals should properly respond to issues in the media.
